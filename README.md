## File Overview

### [`Cargo.toml`](./Cargo.toml)
The manifest file for Rust, defining your package, dependencies, and other metadata.

### [`src/main.rs`](./src/main.rs)
The entry point of your application. This file typically handles command-line argument parsing, possibly using crates like `clap` or `structopt`, and coordinates the high-level flow of the application.

### [`src/lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs)
Contains the core functionality of your application, making it possible to use your code as a library in other Rust projects. This is where you'd define public modules and interfaces.

### [`src/config.rs`](./src/config.rs)
Dedicated to configuration handling, including parsing command-line arguments or configuration files, validating them, and possibly defining default values.

### [`src/processor.rs`](./src/processor.rs)
Contains the logic for processing files and directories, including reading files, removing comments based on the specified rules, and writing the changes.

### [`src/utils.rs`](./src/utils.rs)
Utility functions and helpers that don't neatly fit into other modules, such as common operations used across multiple modules.

### [`tests/`](./tests)
Contains your test code, including:
- **[`integration_test.rs`](./tests/integration_test.rs)**: Tests the application as a whole.
- **[`processor_test.rs`](./tests/processor_test.rs)**: Unit tests for specific parts of the logic, such as comment removal.

### [`examples/`](./examples)
If your application uses configuration files or has complex usage patterns, providing example configurations or scripts can help users get started.
- **[`example_config.json`](./examples/example_config.json)**: Example configuration file, if applicable.

### [`benches/`](./benches)
If performance is a critical aspect of your application, you might include benchmark tests here to measure and track the performance of key operations.
- **[`performance.rs`](./benches/performance.rs)**: Benchmark tests.
